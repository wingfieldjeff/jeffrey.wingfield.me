# The Why

I have wanted to set up a blog for some time. It seems the trend in IT, Cybersecurity, and especially software development to use a blog as a sort of live resume (as well as a place to put a regular resume). It's really good evidence that you, as a professional, enjoy this kind of work and are active in it. It says "Hey look! I am a real person. I actually do this stuff. Check out what I'm up to. Hire me!" In a way that a resume and a coding challenge just can't. There are a variety of ways to set this up. [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/websites/create-a-blog) for example, can get you going in an hour.

That all makes sense to me and is a perfectly legitimate reason to build a blog. However, I don't think I would be able to to keep up with if for professional reasons alone. I think I would get bored trying to fit buzz words about current CVEs into posts. I think I would get annoyed with logging into a web app and clicking through menus to paste text in a box. I think I would write 3 or 4 posts, upload a copy of my resume, and forget that the blog exists for months at a time.

I think that what I need is simpler, faster, and less focused.
